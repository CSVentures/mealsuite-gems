===============================================================================

  YASS (YAML Assisted Seed System) has been installed!

===============================================================================

Generated files:
  * db/migrate/create_yass_seed_registry_entries.rb
  * config/initializers/yass.rb
  * routes.rb (added mount point for YASS engine)

Next steps:

  1. Run the migration:
     
     rails db:migrate

  2. Visit the YASS web interface:
     
     http://localhost:3000/yass

  3. Create YAML seed files in the yass/ directory:

     mkdir -p yass/examples
     
     # Create yass/examples/basic.yml with:
     
     metadata:
       context: "Test Data"
       description: "Example seed data"
     
     data:
       users:
         - factory: user
           attributes:
             name: "Test User"
           ref: "@test_user"

  4. Use the YASS web interface to:
     - Load and validate YAML files
     - Browse the seed registry
     - View file contents and object counts
     - Manage created objects

  5. Alternatively, load programmatically:

     # In Rails console or seed file:
     Yass::Loader.load_from_content(File.read('yass/examples/basic.yml'))

YASS Web Interface Features:
  * Data Seeding: Advanced file loading with validation
  * Seed Registry: Browse and manage created objects  
  * File Analysis: View YAML contents and object counts
  * Real-time Validation: Check syntax and FactoryBot compatibility
